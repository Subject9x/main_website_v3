I created the first draft of the rules back in late 2014 and have built on those rules on-and-off over the past several years. The game is inspired by both tabletop wargaming and tournament fighter video games. I loved the idea of player-customizable move sets, and the fiddly rules that come with tabletop wargaming. I wanted to capture the feeling of commanding a powerful armored suit, but also not have the game take hours to play."," the game has come a long way from those early days. I’ve learned much about how gameplay is taught, and how people react to a new game. I’ve planned a full release which will include colored graphics for the Action Cards, custom artwork for the pawn pieces, tokens, etc."],"media":["/img/bgs/suit/bsuit1.jpg","/img/bgs/suit/bsuit2.jpg","/img/bgs/suit/bsuit3.jpg","/img/bgs/suit/bsuit4.jpg","/img/bgs/suit/bsuit6.png","/img/bgs/suit/bsuit7.jpg"]}
