Off and on over the years I had toyed with the idea of trying to reverse engineer the game, seeing as it is abandoned. The game was released in 1996, well before modding and the desire for open-source had taken root. In 2024 I finally set down to see what I could do with the information several people had collected since the 2000s.","Turns out, I was able to do a lot. Using the HxD edit, refreshing myself on memory types, and some grunt work marching through files flipping bytes here and there. Currently I`ve mapped out a dozen or so of Earthsiege 2`s key game files, unlocking some wonderful modding capabilities."]}
