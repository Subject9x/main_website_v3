Additionally, we possess a large number of wargame miniatures from several different ranges and not enough time to play each individual game. Ergo, we wrote a rules engine that took many of our favorite mechanics from other games and synthesized them into our own system. We also created a unit design system that can account for almost any unit a player wants.","The end result is a wargame that’s fairly open-ended, limited by the creativity of the players involved. LANDWAR is also fairly accessible, with the rules available online for free, and the Unit Calculator as a webpage app for free as well."],"media":["/img/bgs/lwr/landwar (1).jpg","/img/bgs/lwr/landwar (2).jpg","/img/bgs/lwr/landwar (3).jpg","/img/bgs/lwr/landwar (4).jpg","/img/bgs/lwr/landwar (5).jpg","/img/bgs/lwr/landwar (6).jpg"]}
